Finally my first blog came out. This is the first step for me to write down technical knowledge I learn from courses and work.
 I think writing can definitely help me organize and summarize the knowledge. Even though I managed to set up the blog site, consistency of publishing blogs is the only way to secure the most of gain from writing blogs.

Next I'm gong demonstrate how I set up my blog site from a very high level overview.

## Blog Engine
I use HEXO to write blog by Markdown which seems very cool I think. Here is the [official site](https://hexo.io/) of the framework. The documentation is very good and you should be able to install it within a minute or so.

## Server
For simplicity, I use HEXO server to handle the request. Because I just start using it, I'll share my experience using it.

## Host
I use Google Cloud Engine to host my server and files. In fact, I built a Kubernetes cluster and use Docker container to deploy the code. My choice seems overkill but it's a lot of fun playing around with GCE.

## Code Repo
GitHub of course. Here is my [code](https://github.com/ccgogo123/blog) and feel free to fork.

## Conclusion
I'll publish more detailed blogs describing how I set up the cluster and configure the public domain.

Happy coding :)
